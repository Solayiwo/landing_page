            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This project was inspired by the need for a fast and reliable way to compress images without
                losing quality. Also, it was inspired by the growing need for efficient image storage and
                transmission. In the era of digital media, users and companies are constantly dealing with
                large volumes of images. This not only consumes storage space but also increases load times
                for web applications. We wanted to solve this problem by offering a tool that could compress
                images while maintaining quality, making them easier to store and share without significant
                loss in clarity.
            </p>
            <p>It was developed as part of the Holberton School Portfolio Project.</p>
